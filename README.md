# DS4002Project1

## Section 1: Software and platform section

This project was completed using Mac and Windows platforms. The coding language used was Python and the coding environment was Google Colab. The Readability Python package was used, for which documentation can be accessed here: https://pypi.org/project/readability/

## Section 2: Map of Documentation

### This repository is organized as follows:

1. DATA
    - DataInstructions --> steps for accessing and importing the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset.
2. SCRIPTS
    - Script_1.ipynb --> a full script containing all of the code needed to reproduce results.
    - data_appendix_output.R --> a script containing the code used to produce EDA plots in the data appendix.
3. OUTPUT
    - Exploratory Data plots
    - Single Linear Regression Analysis (Phase 1)
    - Multiple Linear Regression Analysis (Phase 2)
4. LICENSE.md
5. README.md


## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing results

### Please follow these steps in order to replicate this project's experimental design:

1. Open the Project_1.ipynb file (located in the SCRIPTS folder) using the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file
2. Following the Instructions File in the DATA folder, import the data into the Colab workspace
3. After the data has been successfully imported, run each code cell in the project file. The first section will clean the data, the next will generate readability scores, and the last few will perform singular/multiple Linear Regression to analyze correlation
