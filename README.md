# DS4002Project1

## Section 1: Software and platform section

This project was completed using Mac and Windows platforms. The coding language used was Python. The Readability Python package was used, for which documentation can be accessed here: https://pypi.org/project/readability/

## Section 2: Map of Documentation

### This repository is organized as follows:

1. DATA
    - "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset
2. SCRIPTS
    - 
3. OUTPUT
    - 
3. LICENSE.md
5. README.md


## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing results

### Please follow these steps in order to replicate this project's experimental design:

1. Open the Project_1.ipynb file (located in the SCRIPTS folder) using the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file
-  The dataset used for this project was found on Kaggle and is too large to be stored on Github. To access the dataset, the very first section of code imports the dataset from kaggle into Colab.
-  The link in the code expires 5-7 days after it is generated, so if an error is thrown an new link must be generated
-      Navigate to the [Kaggle site]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)) containing the raw dataset
-      Click the three dots in the upper right corner to create and save a new notebook
-      Go to the home page of the new notebook, click the three dots in the upper right corner and select "Open in Colab"
-      This will open a new window in Google Colab with the necessary code already generated.
-      You can then copy this cell into the project_1.ipynb file to replace the expired credentials
-  Alternatively, you can download the dataset directly from the kaggle webpage and open it from your computer using Colab
2. After the data has been successfully imported, run each code cell in the project file to clean the data, generate readability scores, and perform singular/Multiple Linear Regression
