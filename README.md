## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results.
In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to
reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be
written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but
detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user
to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section
will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to
reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to
explain this section thoroughly.

### Please follow these steps in order to replicate this project's experimental design:
#### 1. Access the project dataset "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" via this link on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
#### 2. Using the code in the Project_1.ipynb file, import the required packages and import the code from Kaggle into the Colab workspace.
#### 3. Using the code in the Project_1.ipynb file, store the food review data into a dataframe and clean the data by removing extraneous variables.
